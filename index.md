# Purpose
I made Budget in an effort to make expense tracking easier for all. As a college student, I quickly learned how inportant it was to be financially responsible. Before Budget, I'd record all my personal expenses on an Excel spreadsheet on my iPhone -- it was tedious work. Budget allows me to quickly categorize an record each expense. It has made me financially concious, and I hope it does the same for you!
